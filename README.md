C - Stacks and Queues - LIFO, FIFO


This is a readme file that provides an overview of stacks and queues in the C programming language. It explains the concepts of LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out), and how they are implemented using stacks and queues, respectively.

Stacks

A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO principle, which means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top.

Queues

A queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO principle, which means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Think of it as a line of people waiting, where the person who arrived first will be served first.

Conclusion
Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures in computer science. Stacks follow the LIFO principle and can be used in various applications like function call stack, undo/redo functionality, etc. Queues follow the FIFO principle and find applications in areas like scheduling, breadth-first search, and handling requests in web servers, among others.

These simple implementations provide a starting point to understand stacks and queues in C. Feel free to modify and enhance them according to your specific requirements.
